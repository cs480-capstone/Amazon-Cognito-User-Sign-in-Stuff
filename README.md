# Amazon-Cognito-User-Sign-in-Stuff

The account, confirm, confirmSignIn, confirmSignUp and login all go in the src directory of the project in the pages 
directory. awsmobilejs and cors-policy.xml both sit in the first directory of the project. aws-sdk.js and aws-sdk.min.js both 
belong in the project/www/assets directory. aws-exports.js also belongs in the src directory, and the providers.ts belongs in 
the providers directory.
